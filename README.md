## Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary permissions.
- Terraform installed locally.
- Docker installed locally.
- Kubernetes cluster configured (e.g., using kubectl).
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.

## AWS Setup using Terraform
1. Navigate to the `terraform` directory.
2. Open `main.tf` and update the required variables such as `region`, `ami`, and `instance_type`.
3. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Verify that the AWS resources (EC2 instance, VPC, etc.) have been created successfully.

## Docker Configuration
1. Navigate to the root directory.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` and ensure that the required dependencies and Valhalla server configurations are set correctly.
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t valhalla-server .
   ```

## Kubernetes Deployment
1. Navigate to the `kubernetes` directory.
2. Open `valhalla-deployment.yaml` and update the image URL with your ECR URL.
3. Apply the Kubernetes configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f valhalla-deployment.yaml
   ```
4. Ensure that the Valhalla pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

## Load Balancing and Scalability
- Load balancing is automatically handled by the AWS Load Balancer in the Kubernetes Service configuration.

## Networking and Security
- Networking and security configurations are managed by Terraform (VPC, security groups) and Kubernetes (Service).

## Testing and Accessibility
1. Perform load testing using a tool like Apache Benchmark:
   ```bash
   ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://<LoadBalancer-Public-DNS>/route-service
   ```
2. Verify accessibility by accessing the public URL of the Load Balancer in a web browser.

## Bonus Tasks
### Monitoring and Logging
- Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. Configure container logging to AWS CloudWatch.

### Scalability Plan
- Describe your scalability plan considering auto-scaling groups, database optimization, and caching strategies.

## FAQs
1. **Q:** What if I encounter issues during deployment?
   **A:** Check the logs of the Valhalla pods using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` for troubleshooting.

2. **Q:** How can I scale the Valhalla server for higher loads?
   **A:** Refer to the scalability plan in the bonus tasks section.
